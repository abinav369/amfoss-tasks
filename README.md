**Self Intro:**
Vanakam(Greetings in tamil) all!! 
I am Abinav of CSE-B. 
I am from Tamil Nadu. 
I am a linux enthusiast. 
I do have knowledge on programming . 
I have learnt C++(Hopefully I remeber), Python and currently learning Golang. But, my logical part needs working though. 
I have also written a bash script and hence I do have some knowledge on bash scripting. 
If you wish you can check these two youtube channels of mine. https://www.youtube.com/@Mr_Mighty (currently inactive) https://www.youtube.com/@anbu-amma 
I do know git for version control ofcourse. 
I go with the philosophy of open source. 
I wish to know the engineering part of everything that I use, apart from the end user part. 
I am interested in flute( I have started learning but I need a tutor) and I am good at table tennis. It is like more of what I know than a self-intro. 
I use arch btw.
