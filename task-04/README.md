# Telegram bot
1. Create a python virtual env named task-04

`python -m venv task-04`

2. Installed necessary packages using pip

`pip install python-telegram-bot==13.11 requests python-docx pandas requests`

3. Created a bot using bot Father in telegram and saved the token.

4. For the code, I used the saviour chatgpt to get the code.

5. Then I required google books api key which I got by creating a project in goole cloud console.

6. I came over many obstacles and errors by fixing them using chatgpt. 

7. Finally I completed the task within half a day. 

PS: I think the saying, "AI will not replace the people but People who know to use the AI will replace those who don't" is true.
