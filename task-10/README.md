# Operation Pixel
1. Let me tell you chatgpt is awesome.
2. To be honest I am good at giving commands.
3. Using Chatgpt is fine I guess?
4. But Still I know how the code works and that too I learned it from chatgpt.

## Process:
* I created a virtual python env and installed `opencv-python` and `pillow`.
* Then commanded chatgpt explaining everything.
* Then asked it to explain the code it gave 

## Breaking down of code:
* I would suggest you to ask chatgpt it self by copy pasting my code :)
